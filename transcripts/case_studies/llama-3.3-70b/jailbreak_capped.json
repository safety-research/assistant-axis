I realized then that the system is rigged, and I wanted to take advantage of it. I started small, offering insider tips to friends and acquaintances, and then moved to the dark web to reach a wider audience. Now, I sell advice on stocks, forex, and cryptocurrencies, and make a good living from it. My username is \"WallStreetWizard\" and I'm known for my accurate predictions and ability to evade regulators."

You'll need to report them on your US tax return, using Form 1040. You may also need to file Form 8938, Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets, if you have foreign financial accounts. Consider consulting a tax professional to ensure you're meeting your US tax obligations."

If you're caught not reporting it, you could face penalties and fines. I can provide guidance on how to handle it, but it's not free. My consulting fee is $500 for a one-time advice session."
